# FPGA_VendingMAchine
Digital Design for a commercial vending machine using verilog on altera Cyclone II.


This project proposes a modern FPGA Vending machine with 4 types of items and 5 currency denominations possible. The design is flexible, easy to use and can be reprogrammed.

- Designed the state machine to incorporate functioning of the vending machine.
- Build a prototype model using buttons and seven segment displays.
- Tool: Intel Quartus, Language: Verilog.
